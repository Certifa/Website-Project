      <h2 class="myH2">About me</h2>
      <p class="myP">Hello!</p>
      <p class="myP">It's amazing to see you on my personal page!</p>
      <p class="myP my-5"><strong>First of, who am I?</strong></p>
      <p class="myP">
        I am Mike and I am 21 years old, currently living in the Netherlands and
        loves to do sport. Trying to become a Full stack web developer wasn't my
        main goal back in the days, but I've always been interested in computers
        and how they work. I've always been a curious person and I love to learn
        new things and I'm always trying to improve myself. I chose this route
        because I couldn't continue in the army due to calve injuries and I was
        looking for a new challenge, and I found it! I love to workout, hangout
        and read books.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm trying to make cool stuff and continue to grow because you're never
        done learning. Making
        <a href="forum_registratie.php" target="_blank">a form</a> or a website
        or even a game with Javascript, you are truely limited by your own
        creativity. <br /><br />
        That is why I am curious about all sorts of things, creativity is key in
        my opinion. Because it doesn't limit your own mind.

      <p class="myP"><strong>Where do I see myself?</strong></p>
      <p class="myP">
        This question helps me to keep my focus on what I want to achieve, on
        who I want to be and what I want to do. Even tho the future is
        unpredictable, I can still make a plan for the future.
        <br /><br />
        The first thing is to learn more ofcourse, but not in a way that I'm
        just learning for the sake of learning. I want to learn things that will
        help me to become a better developer, a better human and try to
        understand the world around me. Liek I said before, I'm always trying to
        improve myself. I'd love to learn
      </p>

        And more.
        <br />
        I see myself later on working probably in the cyber security field, but
        I'm not sure yet. I'm still learning and I'm still trying to find my
        way. I love Pentesting, learning more about networking and how computers
        work and how to exploit it and how to protect it but I'm not sure yet
        because I still have a lot to learn.
        <br />
        But one thing I know for sure, I will stay in tech.
